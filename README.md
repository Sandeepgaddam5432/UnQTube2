## Installation & Deployment üì•

### Prerequisites

- Try to avoid using **Chinese paths** to prevent unexpected issues
- Please ensure your **internet connection** is working properly, VPN needs to be set to `global traffic` mode

#### ‚ë† Clone the Code

```shell
git clone https://github.com/Sandeepgaddam5432/UnQTube2.git
```

#### ‚ë° Modify Configuration File (Optional, you can also configure in the WebUI after launch)

- Copy the `config.example.toml` file and rename it to `config.toml`
- Follow the instructions in the `config.toml` file to configure `pexels_api_keys` and `llm_provider`, and set up the corresponding API Key based on your chosen LLM provider

### Docker Deployment üê≥

#### ‚ë† Create Virtual Environment

It is recommended to use [conda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html) to create a Python virtual environment

```shell
git clone https://github.com/Sandeepgaddam5432/UnQTube2.git
cd UnQTube2
conda create -n UnQTube2 python=3.11
conda activate UnQTube2
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### ‚ë° Install ImageMagick

- Windows:
    - Download from https://imagemagick.org/script/download.php - select Windows version, make sure to choose the **static library** version, such as ImageMagick-7.1.1-32-Q16-x64-**static**.exe
    - Install the downloaded ImageMagick, **do not change the installation path**
    - Modify the `imagemagick_path` in `config.toml` to your **actual installation path**

- MacOS:
  ```shell
  brew install imagemagick
  ````
- Ubuntu
  ```shell
  sudo apt-get install imagemagick
  ```
- CentOS
  ```shell
  sudo yum install ImageMagick
  ```

#### ‚ë¢ Start Web Interface üåê

Note that you need to execute the following commands in the `root directory` of the UnQTube2 project

###### Windows

```bat
webui.bat
```

###### MacOS or Linux

```shell
sh webui.sh
```

After launching, the browser will open automatically (if it opens blank, it is recommended to use **Chrome** or **Edge**)

#### ‚ë£ Start API Service üöÄ

```shell
python main.py
```

After starting, you can view the `API Documentation` at http://127.0.0.1:8080/docs or http://127.0.0.1:8080/redoc for direct online testing.

## Voice Synthesis üó£

For a complete list of all supported voices, see: [Voice List](./docs/voice-list.txt)

As of 2024-04-16 (v1.1.2), 9 new Azure voice synthesis options were added, which require API KEY configuration. These voices sound more realistic.

## Subtitle Generation üìú

Currently, two subtitle generation methods are supported:

- **edge**: Faster generation, better performance, no specific computer requirements, but quality may be inconsistent
- **whisper**: Slower generation, worse performance, some computer requirements, but more reliable quality.

You can switch between them by modifying the `subtitle_provider` in the `config.toml` configuration file

It's recommended to use the `edge` mode first, and if subtitle quality is unsatisfactory, switch to `whisper` mode

> Note:

1. Whisper mode requires downloading a model file from HuggingFace (approximately 3GB), please ensure your network connection is stable
2. If left blank, subtitles will not be generated.

> For users in China who cannot access HuggingFace, you can download the `whisper-large-v3` model file using the following methods

Download links:

- Google Drive: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1QX3B1YMe4H3g0lJCrN9fymO-lY_BDjXJ?usp=sharing

After downloading the model, extract it and place the entire directory in `.\UnQTube2\models`,
The final file path should look like this: `.\UnQTube2\models\whisper-large-v3`

```
UnQTube2  
  ‚îú‚îÄmodels
  ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄwhisper-large-v3
  ‚îÇ          config.json
  ‚îÇ          model.bin
  ‚îÇ          preprocessor_config.json
  ‚îÇ          tokenizer.json
  ‚îÇ          vocabulary.json
```

## Background Music üéµ

Background music for videos is located in the `resource/songs` directory of the project.
> The project includes some default music from YouTube videos. Please remove if there are any copyright concerns.

## Subtitle Fonts üÖ∞

Fonts used for video subtitles are located in the `resource/fonts` directory of the project. You can add your own fonts here.

## Common Issues ü§î

### ‚ùìRuntimeError: No ffmpeg exe could be found

Under normal circumstances, ffmpeg is downloaded automatically and detected automatically.
However, if there is an issue with your environment that prevents automatic downloading, you might encounter the following error:

```
RuntimeError: No ffmpeg exe could be found.
Install ffmpeg on your system, or set the IMAGEIO_FFMPEG_EXE environment variable.
```

In such cases, you can download ffmpeg from https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/, extract it, and set `ffmpeg_path` to your actual installation path.

```toml
[app]
# Please set according to your actual path, note that Windows path separator is \\
ffmpeg_path = "C:\\Users\\user\\Downloads\\ffmpeg.exe"
```

### ‚ùìImageMagick's security policy blocks operations related to temporary file @/tmp/tmpur5hyyto.txt

You can find these policies in ImageMagick's configuration file policy.xml.
This file is typically located at /etc/ImageMagick-`X`/ or a similar location in the ImageMagick installation directory.
Modify the entry containing `pattern="@"` by changing `rights="none"` to `rights="read|write"` to allow read and write operations on files.

### ‚ùìOSError: [Errno 24] Too many open files

This issue is caused by system limitations on the number of open files. You can solve it by modifying the system's file open limit.

Check current limit:

```shell
ulimit -n
```

If it's too low, increase it:

```shell
ulimit -n 10240
```

### ‚ùìWhisper model download failure, with errors like:

LocalEntryNotFoundError: Cannot find an appropriate cached snapshot folder for the specified revision on the local disk and
outgoing traffic has been disabled. To enable repo look-ups and downloads online, pass 'local files only=False' as input.

Or:

An error occurred while synchronizing the model Systran/faster-whisper-large-v3 from the Hugging Face Hub:
An error happened while trying to locate the files on the Hub and we cannot find the appropriate snapshot folder for the
specified revision on the local disk. Please check your internet connection and try again.
Trying to load the model directly from the local cache, if it exists.

Solution: [Click to see how to manually download the model from Google Drive](#subtitle-generation-)
